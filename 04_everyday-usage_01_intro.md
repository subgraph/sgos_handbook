# Everyday usage

Subgraph OS comes with a number of applications that may already be familiar. 
We have also added newer alternatives that may be less familiar. This chapter
shows you how to use these applications to perform everyday tasks. 

Subgraph OS is also unique because the applications we have included are run
inside of a security sandbox. We call this sandbox Oz. Oz helps protect the 
operating system and your personal files in case an application is 
compromised by a security vulnerability. 

Each application described in this chapter runs inside an Oz sandbox. This
means that they can only access the files and directories that they need to.
Each of the applications is isolated from each other. They are also isolated 
from the system itself. Because the applications are isolated, they cannot 
access common directories such as `Pictures` or `Downloads` in the usual way. 
This chapter shows you how to manage your files in Oz, with some examples for 
each application.
