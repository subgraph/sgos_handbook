# Subgraph OS Handbook

The Subgraph OS Handbook is a user guide for Subgraph OS, covering basic 
everyday uses as well as the advanced configuration. 

The Subgraph OS Handbook is written in Markdown. This is so that we can 
have a single source text that can be converted to multiple output formats, 
such as PDF, DocBook, Epub, and HTML.

The goal of the Subgraph OS Handbook is to provide operating system
documentation that is readable and translatable. The handbook is organized into
sections for beginners and advanced users. 

The current roadmap for this project is the following:
1. Finish the document conversion framework
2. Add support for translation such that the single source text can be 
translated and localized versions of the handbook can be generated for each
output type
3. Finish writing the content, adding graphics, etc.
4. Publish the finished handbook, including making it available in a Debian
package for Subgraph OS, putting sections onto our website, etc.


## Pull requests

The Subgraph OS Handbook is a work in progress. We will most likely not accept 
pull requests until the framework for generating the document and translation 
artifacts is complete and the text is mostly written. This is just to maintain 
consistency (ie: using the same voice throughout, ensuring the text meets the 
readability guidelines we are targetting, etc.). As the framework is not yet
mature, the most important thing at this stage is that the document and 
translation artifacts build correctly. The bulk of the content is due to be
added once the framework is mature.
